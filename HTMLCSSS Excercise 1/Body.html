    <h1>CONTENT PAGE FOR EXCERCISE 1</h1>

    "The main page content appears inside the body tag. HTML contains several
    elements that allow you to properly structure and format your content, which
    we'll cover later."  I have copied and pasted the content from the template
    in my body tag for problem 3 of the excercise. - Robsen Ali
